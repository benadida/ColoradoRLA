<p>Separate from the RLA application server and client software that supports the Department of State and the Counties in carrying out the Risk Limiting Audit, there is a command, called <code>rla_export</code>, allowing export of data from the central server and the underlying database.</p>
<p>The command is part of a python package, whose technical description can be found in a <code>README.rst</code> file in the python site-packages directory tree wherever the package is installed. The most current online version (which may or may not match the version you have installed) is available in the <a href="https://github.com/FreeAndFair/ColoradoRLA/tree/auditcenter/server/eclipse-project/script/rla_export">public code repository</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>README.rst</code> file gives instructions for installing the python package, and describes various run-time options. For a catalog of the exports produced by the command, see below.</p>

<p>To allow independent verification of the RLA, the Colorado Department of State must provide to the following to the public :</p>
<ul>
<li>all CVR files and their SHA-256 hashes</li>
<li>all ballot manifest files and their SHA-256 hashes</li>
<li>the list of contests selected for audit, and which if any have been designated for hand count</li>
<li>opportunity to observe the random seed selection</li>
<li>for each County, the random sequence of ballot cards determined by the random seed and the pseudo-random number generator</li>
<li>opportunity to observe the activities of the County Audit Boards</li>
<li>announced tabulated results for contests selected for audit</li>
<li>the risk limit</li>
<li>the error inflation factor</li>
<li>the tabulation of results and counts of ballot cards used to calculate the diluted margin (including the number of winners for each contest selected for audit)</li>
<li>for each County and each round of the audit, the list of ballot cards assigned to the Audit Board for review</li>
<li>for each contest selected for audit, and for each cast vote record that contains the given contest and has been presented to the Audit Board for verification, the RLA system's record of the Audit Board's review of the physical ballot for that contest</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="exports"><a href="#exports">Exports</a></h1>
<p>The <code>rla_export</code> command exports many of the files necessary for independent verification of the RLA, whether by candidates, parties, other organizations.</p>
<h2 id="database-exports-in.csv-and-.json-format"><a href="#database-exports-in.csv-and-.json-format">Database Exports in.csv and .json format</a></h2>
<p>These data files in this section are generated based on <code>sql</code> query files. These are always produced in two formats: <code>.json</code> and <code>.csv</code>. The basename of each resulting file is the same as the basename of the query file. For example, the query file <code>seed.sql</code>, produces files <code>seed.json</code> and <code>seed.csv</code>.</p>
<p>Specific exports are detailed below.</p>

<p>This file contains, for each contest under audit, and for each cast vote record that contains the given contest and has been presented to the Audit Board for verification, the RLA system's record of the Audit Board's review of the physical ballot for that contest.</p>
<p>Note that the number of discrepancies each cast vote record contributes to the risk level calculation depends not only on the discrepancies found between the cast vote record and the Audit Board interpretation, but also on the number of times that the cast vote record has occurred in the random sequence.</p>

<p>There is a separate report (in .xlsx format) for each County. Within each County's report there is a separate spreadsheet for each round of the audit containing the list of ballot cards assigned to the County Audit Board for that Round. For each ballot card in the list the spreadsheet indicates whether it has been reviewed, whether any discrepancies were found on the card and whether the Audit Board disagreed on the interpretation of the card. There is a summary page with a variety of audit information, and an affirmation page (which will be blank).</p>

<p>When a ballot extends across more than one piece of paper (a &quot;card&quot;), each card is tabulated independently. In Counties which have any multi-card ballots, the ballot card counts provided will be greater than the turnout figures reported elsewhere. For example, in November 2017 the County of Denver had mostly two-card ballots.</p>
